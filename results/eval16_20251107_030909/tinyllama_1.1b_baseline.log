`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!
`pretrained` model kwarg is not of type `str`. Many other model arguments may be ignored. Please do not launch via accelerate or use `parallelize=True` if passing an existing model this way.
Passed an already-initialized model through `pretrained`, assuming single-process call to evaluate() or custom distributed integration
